Test Assignment
Product Management
The aim of this test assignment is to showcase your PM skills, from ideation all the way to
developing a POC to validate your ideas.
Background
Scalable continues to grow rapidly. At the same time, Scalable, now operating as a licensed
CRR credit institution, continues to offer more and more products to its clients. This leads to
challenges in handling the rising amount of customer requests to serve, a growing number of
internal processes to handle, and an ever increasing demand to develop new and better
software faster.
Unsurprisingly, Scalable aims to apply AI tools to address many of these challenges. And it
will be the job of our AI Platform Product Manager to figure out how to best employ AI and
which problems to prioritise. In order to evaluate if you’re up for that task, we’ve come up
with this test assignment to allow you to showcase both your PM skills and AI-affinity.
Please find the specific tasks on the following page.
Task 1 ‐ Create
Brainstorm one idea for how you would apply AI at Scalable to make our products better,
improve the customer experience, or help develop awesome features faster. Then briefly
describe your motivation behind selecting this idea.
Now, with the use of any AI tools of your choice, develop a proof-of-concept
implementation (POC) of that idea. A simple working demo or detailed interactive mockup
is sufficient—we're evaluating resourcefulness and product thinking, not engineering depth.
Task 2 - Quality & Compliance
aka. The "Black Box" Problem
The Legal and Compliance teams are blocking the release of a new AI-enabled feature. They
are worried about hallucinations and Data Leakage.
Define an Evaluation Framework: How do you systematically measure the quality of the AI's
output before releasing it? (Mention specific metrics or methodologies)
Risk Mitigation: What specific "guardrails" would you implement to ensure the AI does not
violate regulatory requirements?

Please share your solution in a format of your choice. Note: We’ll evaluate your solution to
the test assignment on our own and base our decision to continue the hiring process with
you solely based on what you have shared with us.
At Scalable Capital, we value quality over quantity. We expect this test assignment to
take you between 2-5 hrs to complete. Please don’t spend more time on your solution.
Any solution that clearly took more than the specified time to complete will be rejected.
